Setup Jaegar Endpoint UI
Setup MongoDB URI
Minikube

Refer to the README.md to get up and running

I used Minikube tunnel to act as a Network bridge, open a new terminal and enter:
`minikube tunnel`

# Get the service IP addr
`kubectl get svc -n dev`

# Upgrade after templating
`helm upgrade clinic-booking-api . -f values.yaml -n dev`
